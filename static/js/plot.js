const comments = [ "US Weekly Oil Production is witnessing the largest and fastest drop in US history following the Covid-19 shutdown across the world. Normally a fall in oil prices would cause a slower drop in onshore oil production like we witnessed in 2016. However, this time spot prices for crude oil dropped into negative territory across many onshore oil basins in the US due to storage capacity becoming overwhelmed. This caused almost all US oil companies to shut in many of their oil wells and it also caused the largest drop in total US Completions Crews and US Rig Counts in modern history. The combination of these factors is causing US Oil Production to plummet.",
 "US Weekly Oil Consumption has witnessed the largest and fastest drop in US history due to the Covid-19 lockdowns. Millions of Americans stopped driving to work, planes reduced flying, and less oil byproducts are being consumed. Even though jet fuel consumption is still down over 30% the US Oil Consumption is still recovering. The economy is starting open up again and many people are shunning public transportation to drive their cars, which is causing increased gasoline consumption in the US.",
 "US Gasoline prices have dropped dramatically during the Covid-19 shut down due to a combination of falling oil prices and less people driving to work. However, the US Gasoline prices are recovering quickly as the US economy opens up and more people are driving their cars instead of using public transit that is less gasoline intensive.",
 "US Diesel Prices have dropped from the Covid-19 shut downs but the drop has been less significant. The drop in Diesel Prices has been attributed to the drop in Oil Prices, however Diesel consumption has only slightly decreased as semi-truck and truck driving has remained resilient as more products started being delivered to homes.",
 "Crude Oil Prices have seen the most significant drop in world history due to the Covid-19 shut downs. Western Texas Intermediate Oil Prices - based on oil prices in Cushing Oklahoma and Texas - had seen spot prices fall all the way to -$37 a barrel. It was the first time oil prices had traded negative in the US. This was cause by a loss in oil demand, oil wells continuing to produce too much oil, and oil storage capacity running out in many areas. As storage ran out many landlocked oil fields could only sell at negative oil prices. Oil companies were burning cash with every barrel of oil they produced, which forced widespread oil well shut ins." ];
